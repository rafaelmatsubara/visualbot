aesthetic bot
===============
A visual inpiration twitter bot.
The getimg.py is designed to get a JSON from a Unsplash specific collection, then it gets the url and download the pictures in the collection to a folder.
The main.py tweets the images and save the name id to a txt file so it doesn't repeat tweets.
